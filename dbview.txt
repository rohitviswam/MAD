To view data from a database in Android Studio, you can use the following steps:

Open your Android Studio project.
In the project view, right-click on the "app" folder and select "New > Android Resource File".
In the "New Resource File" dialog, select "Database" and click "Next".
In the "Create Database" dialog, enter a name for your database and click "Finish".
The database will be created in the "/assets" folder of your project.
To open the database, you can use the following code:

SQLiteDatabase db = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase("database_name.db", null, SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READWRITE);

The db variable is a reference to the SQLiteDatabase object that you are using to connect to the database.

To create a table in the database, you can use the following code:

Code snippet
String sql = "CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 TEXT, column2 TEXT, column3 TEXT);";
db.execSQL(sql);
Use code with caution. Learn more
The sql variable is a string that contains the SQL statement that you want to execute.

To insert data into the table, you can use the following code:

db.execSQL("INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES ('value1', 'value2', 'value3');");

To view data from the table, you can use the following code:

Code snippet
Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM table_name;", null);

while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
  // Get the column values
  String column1 = cursor.getString(0);
  String column2 = cursor.getString(1);
  String column3 = cursor.getString(2);

  // Do something with the column values
}

cursor.close();

This code will iterate through the rows in the table and print the column values to the console.
